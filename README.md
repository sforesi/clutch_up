## **Getting Started**

[Deployed Link]()


### **Background** 

This is a motorcycle trip tracking app. 

### **Application Description & Overview** 

There are few joys in life that compare to the thrill of riding a motorcycle, there are even fewer hobbyist that are more obsessed than motorcycle riders. In fact, for just about every possible type of motorcycle product you could imagine, there's probably something for it. 

As a rider myself, amongst all these different products, I haven't found an app that allows you to meaningfully track your rides in something of a 'diary' format. This app is meant to fill that gap. Allowing you to track your rides by adding details like a description, distance and top speed.

### **Ice-Box Goals & Improvements to Come** 

AAU I want to be able to add "My Motorcyle" by linking an API, so that I can feel like I'm in my "virtual garage" when I login to the homepage.
AAU I want to be able to add "My Tyres", if possible also by linking an API, so that I can track tyre degredation and performance.
AAU I want to be able to add a Google location to my trip, so that i can see exactly where I've ridden.
AAU I want to be able to link a Youtube video of my ride, so that other users can see my trip and decide if they want to ride there as well.
AAU I want to be able to comment/save other user's trips, so that I can leave my thoughts on that ride or go on that ride myself in the future.
AAU I want to be able to sort my trips by category, so that I can view my ROAD, OFF ROAD, TRACK trips organized by type.
AAU I want to be able to add bike specs and set up to trips, so that I can remember how the bike performed under different circumstances such as varying PSI, fairings, suspension, slip-ons, turbos etc...
